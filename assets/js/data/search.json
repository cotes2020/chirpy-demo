Using the Starter (Recommended)This approach simplifies upgrades, isolates unnecessary files, and is perfect for users who want to focus on writing with minimal configuration. Sign in to GitHub and navigate to the starter. Click the Use this template button and then select Create a new repository. Name the new repository &lt;username&gt;.github.io, replacing username with your lowercase GitHub username.Option 2. Forking the ThemeThis approach is convenient for modifying features or UI design, but presents challenges during upgrades. So don’t try this unless you are familiar with Jekyll and plan to heavily modify this theme. Sign in to GitHub. Fork the theme repository. Name the new repository &lt;username&gt;.github.io, replacing username with your lowercase GitHub username.Setting up the EnvironmentOnce your repository is created, it’s time to set up your development environment. There are two primary methods:Using Dev Containers (Recommended for Windows)Dev Containers offer an isolated environment using Docker, which prevents conflicts with your system and ensures all dependencies are managed within the container.Steps: Install Docker: On Windows/macOS, install Docker Desktop. On Linux, install Docker Engine. Install VS Code and the Dev Containers extension. Clone your repository: For Docker Desktop: Start VS Code and clone your repo in a container volume. For Docker Engine: Clone your repo locally, then open it in a container via VS Code. Wait for the Dev Containers setup to complete.Setting up Natively (Recommended for Unix-like OS)For Unix-like systems, you can set up the environment natively for optimal performance, though you can also use Dev Containers as an alternative.Steps: Follow the Jekyll installation guide to install Jekyll and ensure Git is installed. Clone your repository to your local machine. If you forked the theme, install Node.js and run bash tools/init.sh in the root directory to initialize the repository. Run command bundle in the root of your repository to install the dependencies.UsageStart the Jekyll ServerTo run the site locally, use the following command:$ bundle exec jekyll s If you are using Dev Containers, you must run that command in the VS Code Terminal.After a few seconds, the local server will be available at http://127.0.0.1:4000.ConfigurationUpdate the variables in _config.yml as needed. Some typical options include: url avatar timezone langSocial Contact OptionsSocial contact options are displayed at the bottom of the sidebar. You can enable or disable specific contacts in the _data/contact.yml file.Customizing the StylesheetTo customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss file to the same path in your Jekyll site, and add your custom styles at the end of the file.Starting with version 6.2.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, copy the main SASS file _sass/main.scss to the _sass directory in your site’s source, then create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign your new values there.Customizing Static AssetsStatic assets configuration was introduced in version 5.1.0. The CDN of the static assets is defined in _data/origin/cors.yml. You can replace some of them based on the network conditions in the region where your website is published.If you prefer to self-host the static assets, refer to the chirpy-static-assets repository.DeploymentBefore deploying, check the _config.yml file and ensure the url is configured correctly. If you prefer a project site and don’t use a custom domain, or if you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to set the baseurl to your project name, starting with a slash, e.g., /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy Using Github ActionsPrepare the following: If you’re on the GitHub Free plan, keep your site repository public. If you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repository, and your local machine is not running Linux, update the platform list of the lock file: $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux Next, configure the Pages service: Go to your repository on GitHub. Select the Settings tab, then click Pages in the left navigation bar. In the Source section (under Build and deployment), select GitHub Actions from the dropdown menu. Push any commits to GitHub to trigger the Actions workflow. In the Actions tab of your repository, you should see the workflow Build and Deploy running. Once the build is complete and successful, the site will be deployed automatically. You can now visit the URL provided by GitHub to access your site.Manual Build and DeploymentFor self-hosted servers, you will need to build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Navigate to the root of the source project, and build your site with the following command:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in the _site folder of the project’s root directory. Upload these files to your target server." }, { "title": "Writing a New Post", "url": "/posts/write-a-new-post/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "writing", "date": "2019-08-08 14:10:00 +0800", "snippet": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and P...", "content": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateTo accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Adding author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one).&lt;author_id&gt;: name: &lt;full name&gt; twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt; url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then use author to specify a single entry or authors to specify multiple entries:---author: &lt;author_id&gt; # for single entry# orauthors: [&lt;author1_id&gt;, &lt;author2_id&gt;] # for multiple entries---Having said that, the key author can also identify multiple entries. The benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Post DescriptionBy default, the first words of the post are used to display on the home page for a list of posts, in the Further Reading section, and in the XML of the RSS feed. If you don’t want to display the auto-generated description for the post, you can customize it using the description field in the Front Matter as follows:---description: Short summary of the post.---Additionally, the description text will also be displayed under the post title on the post’s page.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MediaWe refer to images, audio and video as media resources in Chirpy.URL PrefixFrom time to time we have to define duplicate URL prefixes for multiple resources in a post, which is a boring task that you can avoid by setting two parameters. If you are using a CDN to host media files, you can specify the cdn in _config.yml. The URLs of media resources for site avatar and posts are then prefixed with the CDN domain name. cdn: https://cdn.com To specify the resource path prefix for the current post/page range, set media_subpath in the front matter of the post: ---media_subpath: /path/to/media/--- The option site.cdn and page.media_subpath can be used individually or in combination to flexibly compose the final resource URL: [site.cdn/][page.media_subpath/]file.extImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image, then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeTo prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" } For an SVG, you have to at least specify its width, otherwise it won’t be rendered.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right. Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added. Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } Dark/Light modeYou can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (dark or light):![Light mode only](/path/to/light-mode.png){: .light }![Dark mode only](/path/to/dark-mode.png){: .dark }ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }Preview ImageIf you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of 1200 x 630. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet 1.91 : 1, the image will be scaled and cropped.Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image’s attribute:---image: path: /path/to/image alt: image alternative text---Note that the media_subpath can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute path only needs the image file name.For simple use, you can also just use image to define the path.---image: /path/to/image---LQIPFor preview images:---image: lqip: /path/to/lqip-file # or base64 URI--- You can observe LQIP in the preview image of post \"Text and Typography\".For normal images:![Image description](/path/to/image){: lqip=\"/path/to/lqip-file\" }VideoSocial Media PlatformYou can embed videos from social media platforms with the following syntax:{% include embed/{Platform}.html id='{ID}' %}Where Platform is the lowercase of the platform name, and ID is the video ID.The following table shows how to get the two parameters we need in a given video URL, and you can also know the currently supported video platforms. Video URL Platform ID https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-B46URT4mg youtube H-B46URT4mg https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1634779211 twitch 1634779211 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Q44y1B7Wf bilibili BV1Q44y1B7Wf Video FilesIf you want to embed a video file directly, use the following syntax:{% include embed/video.html src='{URL}' %}Where URL is a URL to a video file e.g. /path/to/sample/video.mp4.You can also specify additional attributes for the embedded video file. Here is a full list of attributes allowed. poster='/path/to/poster.png' — poster image for a video that is shown while video is downloading title='Text' — title for a video that appears below the video and looks same as for images autoplay=true — video automatically begins to play back as soon as it can loop=true — automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the video muted=true — audio will be initially silenced types — specify the extensions of additional video formats separated by |. Ensure these files exist in the same directory as your primary video file.Consider an example using all of the above:{% include embed/video.html src='/path/to/video.mp4' types='ogg|mov' poster='poster.png' title='Demo video' autoplay=true loop=true muted=true%}AudiosIf you want to embed an audio file directly, use the following syntax:{% include embed/audio.html src='{URL}' %}Where URL is a URL to an audio file e.g. /path/to/audio.mp3.You can also specify additional attributes for the embedded audio file. Here is a full list of attributes allowed. title='Text' — title for an audio that appears below the audio and looks same as for images types — specify the extensions of additional audio formats separated by |. Ensure these files exist in the same directory as your primary audio file.Consider an example using all of the above:{% include embed/audio.html src='/path/to/audio.mp3' types='ogg|wav|aac' title='Demo audio'%}Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Highlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value``` The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %} This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.MathematicsWe use MathJax to generate mathematics. For website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---After enabling the mathematical feature, you can add math equations with the following syntax: Block math should be added with $$ math $$ with mandatory blank lines before and after $$ Inserting equation numbering should be added with $$\\begin{equation} math \\end{equation}$$ Referencing equation numbering should be done with \\label{eq:label_name} in the equation block and \\eqref{eq:label_name} inline with text (see example below) Inline math (in lines) should be added with $$ math $$ without any blank line before or after $$ Inline math (in lists) should be added with \\$$ math $$&lt;!-- Block math, keep all blank lines --&gt;$$LaTeX_math_expression$$&lt;!-- Equation numbering, keep all blank lines --&gt;$$\\begin{equation} LaTeX_math_expression \\label{eq:label_name}\\end{equation}$$Can be referenced as \\eqref{eq:label_name}.&lt;!-- Inline math in lines, NO blank lines --&gt;\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, $$ LaTeX_math_expression $$ consectetur adipiscing elit.\"&lt;!-- Inline math in lists, escape the first `$` --&gt;1. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$2. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$3. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$ Starting with v7.0.0, configuration options for MathJax have been moved to file assets/js/data/mathjax.js, and you can change the options as needed, such as adding extensions.If you are building the site via chirpy-starter, copy that file from the gem installation directory (check with command bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy) to the same directory in your repository.MermaidMermaid is a great diagram generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.Learn MoreFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts." }, { "title": "Text and Typography", "url": "/posts/text-and-typography/", "categories": "Blogging, Demo", "tags": "typography", "date": "2019-08-08 11:33:00 +0800", "snippet": "HeadingsH1 — headingH2 — headingH3 — headingH4 — headingParagraphQuisque egestas convallis ipsum, ut sollicitudin risus tincidunt a.
